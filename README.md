# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategic twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project expands the classic 3x3 board into a larger 9x9 grid divided into nine smaller boards. Each move you make determines which mini-board your opponent must play on next, adding layers of complexity and strategy to the game.

## Features
- Dynamic 9x9 grid with nine smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards.
- Tracks winners for each mini-board and the overall game.
- Highlights active and completed mini-boards.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.

## How to Play
1. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the mini-boards.
2. The mini-board you play in determines where your opponent must play next.
3. Win three mini-boards in a row to claim victory in the overall game!
